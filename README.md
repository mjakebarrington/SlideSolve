# SlideSolve
(work in progress)
An elementary algorithm for solving numerical slide puzzles such as the one below:

## Instructions:
1. Import board.py into any interactive Python interpreter.
2. Create a new game instance as follows: `game_name = board.Game(x)` where x is size of the matrix. Default board size is 3.
3. You can play (without using the solver algorithm) by `game_name.Play()`. This will enter an interactive game session.
